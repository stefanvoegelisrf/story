# Excercise: Snowflaking writing technique
- Write a wish for the future of the world
  - I wish for the world to have less toxic behavior. People should communicate more directly, what and how they feel. They should not try to manipulate the people they talk to.
- Project into this future and think about a story
  - People are less sad or angry, they are able to better talk about their feelings. They care more about each other and are better able to see the viewpoint of others.
  - Media is much more transparent with their communication and has a clear label what their agenda is and what their viewpoints are.
- Write this story in a short sentence without using countries or names
  - The story is about a community that has a very active feedback culture and a communication guide that people are trained on. It is very easy to learn, but takes some getting used to. Once established, their communication is changed for the better. This community tries to slowly but surely spread their techniques into the world. They do not get on with everyone well, but they arrive at some cities where they can teach some people on their methods. In other cities, they are believed to be a cult.
