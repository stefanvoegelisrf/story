### Introduction
My name is Stefan Vögeli. I was born and raised in the canton of Schwyz. I am a very creative person with a lot of technical skills. My core values are to be open to new perspectives, show interest in peoples lives and societal issues, to think critical and reflect deeply about my personal habits and actions.

### Early life
My parents were originally from the canton of Glarus but decided to move away. I was not raised religiously, which I think was a very good decision of my parents. I grew up in the canton of Schwyz which is rather conservative and has a lot of traditions. I honor the traditions but I also grew to dislike the conservative viewpoints. I developed a very critical political view, questioning capitalism and the right winged point of view. I grew up rather worryfree with lots of privileges. I had lots of friends in school with good education. I was able to do sports, like judo and floorball, and to go to musical education to learn to play the saxophone. I lived in a neighborhood where people lived in terraced houses mostly and there were many children about my age that I could play with. My parents raised me and my brother together. They were rather strict and tried to set clear rules, which we did not follow that strictly. We went on vacation a lot with the sidecar motorcycle, where I saw a lot of france, germany, italy and several other countries.

### School & career
During my school time, I always had good grades in school but I also was quite cheeky and did not follow rules that strictly. After school, I did an apprenticeship as a software engineer at an insurance in the canton of Zurich. I smoked a lot of weed during school and my apprenticeship which accompanied me for quite some time until I finally quit recently. I have worked at several companies as a software engineer where I could gather a lot of experience and also learn that I missed a certain creativity which is why I now am studying Digital Ideation in Lucerne.

### Personal reflections
Through personal challenges and experiences I have learned that it is very important to be aware that everyone has a different upbringing which influenced their decisions in life. It is very important to be aware of these factors to get to know someone on a deep level, which is what interest me most in life.

### Introduction
My name is Dirk Dork, and I was born and raised in the small coastal town of Nordhaven. I have a passion for hands-on work and finding creative solutions to everyday problems. My core values are to remain curious, to seek out diverse experiences, and to reflect on how my actions align with my ideals.

### Early Life
My parents moved to Nordhaven shortly before I was born, drawn by the tranquility of the ocean and the close-knit community. I grew up exploring rocky beaches, crafting wooden sculptures, and sketching in notebooks I carried everywhere. While the town’s traditions were rooted in fishing and trade, I always felt drawn to innovation and the outside world.

Our family lived simple, sharing meals full of laughter and stories. My parents encouraged independence, and they set clear expectations, but also let me pursue my own interests. I spent hours tinkering with broken electronics from my dad's old equipment, where I developed a love for problem-solving. My summers were spent traveling in an old camper van, exploring remote areas of the countryside and learning the beauty of simplicity.

### School & Career
I wasn’t the type to really love the typical school topics, often feeling boxed in by the rules. However, I was very good in subjects where creativity and practical thinking came together. After finishing school, I went on to do an apprenticeship as marine technician, repairing engines and designing small upgrades for fishing boats. It was challenging but rewarding, as I enjoyed doing hands-on work with innovative thinking.

Later, I decided to shift into sustainability design, working on projects to reduce waste in local industries. Though the work was fulfilling, I missed the pure creativity I once found in my early projects. Now, I’m studying eco-focused innovation and design, where I’ve rediscovered my passion for crafting solutions that balance technology and nature.

### Personal Reflections
Over time, I’ve learned the value of listening—to people, to the environment, and even to my own instincts. Everyone carries unique experiences that shape their views, and understanding those perspectives is key to meaningful work and relationships. My goal is to continue creating solutions that not only solve problems but also bring people closer to a shared purpose.
