In the beginning, God was lonely. He has been lonely for a long time. All he knew was loneliness. He often times thought, what would it be like if he wasn't as lonely as he was. What if he had more than himself, like some toys to play with. Something that he could pass the time with instead of tinkering with his thoughts all the time. But what should his toys look like? What should they do? What happens if he gets annoyed of them? Does he really want that, he asked himself. What if they destroyed his peace and loneliness? He though long and hard, exploring all kinds of ideas. He planned everything out in his head. His thoughts made his loneliness go away and he came to the conclusion that he was fine with the loneliness. So he just continued building his though empire, without creating a thing, and he knew it was good.
