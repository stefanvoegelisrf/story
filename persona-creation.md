## Backstory
Brenda was born in her home in Clearwater River, Canada. She is the second born child of her parents Trinity and Benjamin. She has an elder Sister Tanja and a younger brother Tarek. Her Mother is a woodcutter and her dad is working at a fishery. With parents that have such nature related jobs, they often are in nature and so she is quite good at woodcarving, which she mostly learned from her mother. As this is a very quiet hobby, she's a more quite person that has her feelings under control. Her sister is not the same and you more see her running around the woods, throwing stuff and climbing trees. Her brother is also more wild, but likes to have his quiet moments where he is not that activy in likes to enjoy the lovely scenery of canada.
Brendas parents liked to show them how to eat healthy and have a good relationship to nature, but occasionally also try to just lay back and not care. They tend to reuse and repair lots of stuff and take care of their resources. This has sometimes lead to fights with their kids who would like to have new stuff, but it also learned them to take care.

## Inner world
Brenda was not raised religious, so she does not really believe in god. She does not rule out the possibility that there are other life forms in the universe. Sometimes she is intrigued by superhuman stuff. Brenad loves lto eat cheese cake and also bakes herself quite often. This gives her a sense of calmness and with a nice treat for herself. She hates when people throw out trash carelessly. She is quite an understanding person and does not hate people specifically, rather when people behave indifferent or careless. She would like to somehow sell her own woodcarvings and maybe even take it up a step and start woodcutting sculptures with the chainsaw. She works as a teacher at her local school.
